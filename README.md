binaryClassifier.py trains model from dataset, binaryClassifier.h5 is a pretrained model that can be used to evaluate COVID-19 x-rays without training a new model, binary_test.py is an example file for how the pretrained model can be used to evaluate an x-ray image

Necessary Libraries: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, SciKit-Learn
